# CORS

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin (domain) to make requests for resources from a different origin. An origin consists of the combination of protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), domain, and port number.

The same-origin policy is a fundamental security principle that restricts web pages from making requests to a different origin than the one that served the web page. While this policy enhances security, it can also limit the ability of web applications to interact with resources from other domains. CORS was introduced to provide a controlled and secure way for web applications to request resources from different origins.

## Understanding Origin

| URL                                        | Outcome       | Reason                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| http://store.aws.com/dir2/new.html         | Same origin   | Only the path differs                      |
| http://store.aws.com/dir/inner/other.html  | Same origin   | Only the path differs                      |
| https://store.aws.com/page.html            | Different origin | Different protocol                        |
| http://store.aws.com:81/dir/page.html      | Different origin | Different port (http:// is port 80 by default) |
| http://news.aws.com/dir/page.html          | Different origin | Different host                             |

Now, we are ready to jump into learning how CORS works. Let's get started.

## Cross-Origin Requests

When a web page hosted on one origin makes a request to fetch data from a different origin (for example, via XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API), the browser checks whether the target server allows such requests.

## CORS Headers

The server hosting the requested resource responds with specific HTTP headers that indicate whether cross-origin requests from certain origins are allowed. These headers include:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies the origins that are allowed to access the resource. It can be a specific domain or a wildcard (*), which means any origin is allowed.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) that are allowed when accessing the resource.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Lists the HTTP headers that can be used during the actual request.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Indicates whether credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) can be included in the request.
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`: Lists the headers that the client can access as part of the response.

## Simple Requests vs. Preflight Requests

Simple cross-origin requests (e.g., GET and POST without custom headers) are allowed by default. The browser automatically includes the necessary CORS headers in the request and checks the response headers to determine if the request is allowed.

For more complex requests (such as those with custom headers or non-standard methods), the browser first sends a preflight request (an HTTP OPTIONS request) to check if the server supports the actual request. If the preflight request is successful and the server responds with the appropriate CORS headers, the browser sends the actual request.

## Analogy: CORS Explained

Imagine you're on a website called Site A, and you want to grab some information or pictures from a different website called Site B. Normally, web browsers have a rule that says you can't easily do this because it could be risky. It's like saying you can only take things from your own room and not from other people's rooms.

But sometimes, websites want to share things with each other in a safe way. That's where CORS comes in. CORS is like a special pass that Site B gives to Site A, saying, "Okay, you can come in and take stuff from me." This pass has certain rules, like what kind of things Site A can take and what it can do with them.

This way, websites can share information while still staying safe. It's like Site B letting Site A borrow a book for a little while, but only if Site A promises to bring it back and not do anything weird with it. If Site A tries to do something it's not allowed to do, CORS helps Site B stop it and keep everything secure.

## Handling CORS Errors

If the server's CORS headers do not allow the request, the browser will block the request and raise a CORS error. JavaScript on the web page won't be able to access the response data, and the error can be seen in the browser's console.

CORS allows web applications to make controlled cross-origin requests while maintaining security. It's a crucial mechanism for enabling modern web applications to interact with APIs and resources hosted on different domains.

# CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and CORS Comparison

CSRF and CORS are security measures that address different aspects of web application security. They serve distinct purposes and are not directly comparable in terms of which one is "more secure" because they target different types of threats.

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CSRF protection prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized actions on behalf of a user who is authenticated on another website.
Mechanism: CSRF tokens are used to verify that requests come from the expected source and not from a malicious site.
Security Focus: Protects against unauthorized actions initiated by attackers while the user is logged in to another site.
Importance: Crucial for preventing attackers from tricking users into performing actions they didn't intend on other websites where they are authenticated.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS defines rules for how web browsers should handle cross-origin requests to ensure controlled data sharing between different origins.
Mechanism: CORS headers are used to indicate which origins are allowed to access specific resources and under what conditions.
Security Focus: Manages the controlled sharing of resources (data, scripts, etc.) between different domains to avoid potential risks.
Importance: Essential for securing resources while enabling controlled data sharing across origins.

Both CSRF protection and appropriate CORS policies are important in their respective contexts. They work together to ensure the integrity and controlled sharing of data and actions within the application's ecosystem.
